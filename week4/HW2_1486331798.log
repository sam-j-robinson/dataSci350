2017-02-05 13:56:38 INFO::Crude LM equation: x =  1.11072534722201 y +  1.62186823446606
2017-02-05 13:56:38 INFO::Slope Interpretation: For an increase in 1 crude value of hospitilizations we expect the admition rate to increase by 1.11072534722201 . We predict at 0 hospitilizations that the admission rate will be, 1.62186823446606 .
2017-02-05 13:56:38 INFO::Comments: The equation does not make sense for real world analysis. When there are no hispitilizations we can't 
                have a rate of hospitilizations. This is acceptable in understand that coefficient of the model.

2017-02-05 13:56:38 INFO::Diff LM equation: x =  1.0933676417376 y +  0.00116878592958968
2017-02-05 13:56:38 INFO::Slope Interpretation: For an increase in 1 value of differences in hospitilizations we expect the admition rate to increase by 1.0933676417376 . We predict at no change in hospitilizations the admission rate will change by, 0.00116878592958968 .
2017-02-05 13:56:38 INFO::Comments: We can see that when the difference in hospitilizations remains constant that our model does not 
          predict a change in the rate of hospitilizations. It is encouraging seeing that with no rate change we can expect
          a stable rate of admission.

2017-02-05 13:56:38 INFO::With our crude lm SSR value equaling 0.998275236965497 and our difference lm SSR value equaling 0.997966252260164 we can say that both models are close to equally good at predicting expected
                admission rates in hospitals. This is reinforced by equally low p-values for both models.
